TODO:
- Display Names instead of Codes in print reuslts
- Fix County Sort
- Front End?

Please write down the full names and netids of both your team members.
Kaileb Cole (kjc265)
Haris Malik (hm569)

Are there known issues or functions that aren't working currently in your attached code? 
If so, explain. (note that you will get half credit for any reasonably sized bug that is fully explained in the readme)
    - Currently, there is no frontend developed for this program. In addition to this, county sorting is providing issues likely due to the existance of the location table not being used as part of the full final table.
        Lastly, when printing the results of the sorts, codes are still being provided when names should be provided instead.


Collaboration: Who did you collaborate with on this project? What resources and references did you consult? 
Please also specify on what aspect of the project you collaborated or consulted.
    - Outside of working together and information gathered from lecture and the occasional java and JDBC documentation reference, no other external resources were used.
    - Kaileb completed the CLI Interface and interaction and the filter manager, Haris completed the Rate Calculator, Mortgage Search, Database Updater.
    - The Mortgage Creator was developed by both individuals with the remaining files also being added onto and bug fixed by each individual.
    - Overall, a very fair 50% of the workload was taken on by both parties.

What are all the parts that you completed? Be sure to mention which extra credit you attempted here.
    - Command Line Interface Interaction
    - The Backend (Searching, Calculating, Packaging)
    - Filtering by all 7 filters for extra credit
    - Display of Filters
    - Transactions Extra Credit
    - New Mortgage Extra Credit


What problems did you face developing code for this project? Around how long did you spend on this project (This helps me decide what I need to explain more clearly for the next projects)
    - In total, each partner spent about 10 hours working to get the project working successfully.
    - The hardest parts were interfacing with the database via the new JDBC but that came with practice.
    - General usage of PostgreSQL still proved difficult, but came much easier this project than the last with more CL usage to interact with it.
